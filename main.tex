\title{Thouless pump}

\section{Introduction}

This is based on the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model of a quantized nonlinear Thouless pump in an array of coupled waveguides found in \cite{Jurgensen2021}. It is unclear which mathematical formulation we should use for the periodic waveguide coupling (options include mimicking Figure 1b and equation (3) in the supplement). Equation (3) in the supplement has the advantage that we get interesting solutions (both stationary and moving), some of which are stable. However, the coupling parameter in that equation can take negative values, which is nonphysical. Instead, we use the following equation, which essentially involves squaring equation (3) and the adjusting the parameters so that the period is what we want.
\[
J_n(z)= J_0 + C \cos^2\left(  \frac{2 pi}{3} n + \frac{\omega}{2} z + \frac{\pi}{6} \right).
\]
where $n$ is the index of the waveguide in the lattice \cref{fig:J}. Period is $T=2\pi$. The lattice dynamical system is then given by
\[
i \frac{d u_n}{d z} =
-J_n(z) u_{n+1} - J_{n-1}(z)u_{n-1} - g|u_n|^2 u_n,
\]
where we will (unless noted otherwise) take $g = 1$.

\section{Coherent Structures}

Possible coherent structures that can be obtained are left-moving, right-moving, and stationary \cref{fig:coherent}. Left-moving solution moves 3 lattice sites to left in one period, reproduces itself exactly after one period. After one period, it moves one lattice site to the left, with a phase shift of $2\pi/3$). We have found two distinct right-moving solutions, both of which move 3 lattice sites to right in two periods. Note the large difference in powers between these two solutions. The lower power solution moves one lattice site to the right in 2/3 period, with a phase shift of $-2\pi/3$. The higher power solution moves one lattice to the right in 2/3 period, with no phase shift. Stationary solution reproduces itself exactly after one period. Note as well the presence of nanoptera in the moving solutions.

\section{Parameter continuation}

Parameter continuation in $C$ can be performed on these solutions. Note that for the left-moving and lower power right-moving solution, there is a critical value of $C$ at which the nanoptera disappear. This value is different for these two solutions. This does not occur for the high-power right-moving solution.
