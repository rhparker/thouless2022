abstract = {In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the study of wave propagation in nonlinear photonic lattices. The interplay between nonlinearity and periodicity has led researchers to manipulate light and discover new and interesting phenomena such as new classes of localized modes, usually referred to as solitons, and novel surface states that propagate robustly. A field where both nonlinearity and periodicity arises naturally is nonlinear optics. But there are other areas where waves propagating on background lattices play an important role, including photonic crystal fibers and Bose–Einstein condensation. In this review article the propagation of wave envelopes in one and two-dimensional periodic lattices associated with additional potential in the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation, termed lattice NLS equations, are studied. A discrete reduction, known as the tight-binding approximation, is employed to find the linear dispersion relation and the equations governing nonlinear discrete envelopes for two-dimensional simple periodic lattices and two-dimensional non-simple honeycomb lattices. In the limit under which the envelopes vary slowly, continuous envelope equations are derived from the discrete system. The coefficients of the linear evolution system are related to the dispersion relation in both the discrete and continuous cases. For simple lattices, the continuous systems are NLS type equations. In honeycomb lattices, in certain cases, the continuous system is found to be nonlinear Dirac equations. Finally, it is possible to realize so-called topological insulator systems in an optical waveguide setting. The modes supported by these systems are associated with spectral topological invariants and, remarkably, can propagate without backscatter from lattice defects.}

abstract = {We provide an overview of recent experimental and theoretical developments in the area of optical discrete solitons. By nature, discrete solitons represent self-trapped wavepackets in nonlinear periodic structures and result from the interplay between lattice diffraction (or dispersion) and material nonlinearity. In optics, this class of self-localized states has been successfully observed in both one- and two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. In recent years such photonic lattices have been implemented or induced in a variety of material systems, including those with cubic (Kerr), quadratic, photorefractive, and liquid-crystal nonlinearities. In all cases the underlying periodicity or discreteness leads to altogether new families of optical solitons that have no counterpart whatsoever in continuous systems. We first review the linear properties of photonic lattices that are key in the understanding of discrete solitons. The physics and dynamics of the fundamental discrete and gap solitons are then analyzed along with those of many other exotic classes — e.g. twisted, vector and multi-band, cavity, spatio-temporal, random-phase, vortex, and non-local lattice solitons, just to mention a few. The possibility of all-optically routing optical discrete solitons in 2D and 3D periodic environments using soliton collisions is also presented. Finally, soliton formation in optical quasi-crystals and at the boundaries of waveguide array structures are discussed.}

abstract = {When the two arcs of the continuous phonon spectrum of the Floquet matrix of a discrete breather overlap on the unit circle, the breather solution in the infinite lattice might be stable while the corresponding solutions in finite systems appear to be unstable. More precisely, when the model parameters vary, the breather in the finite system exhibits a large number of collisions between the Floquet eigenvalues belonging to the phonon spectrum. These collisions correspond to complex cascades of instability thresholds followed near after by re-entrant stability thresholds. We interpret this complex structure on the basis of the band analysis of the matrix of the second variation of the action. Then we can predict that in the limit of an infinite system the number of instability and stability thresholds in the cascade diverges, but simultaneously the maximum amplitude of the instabilities vanishes, so that the breather in the infinite system recovers its linear stability (as long as all its other localized modes remain stable). This is the situation which is required in Cretegny et al. [Physica D 119 (1998) 73–87] for having inelastic phonon scattering with two channels. We also analyze the size effects when a Floquet eigenvalue associated with a localized mode collides with the Floquet continuous phonon spectrum with different Krein signature. In contrast to the previous case, the infinite system is unstable after the collision.}

Only nearest neighbor Hooke's law interactions are considered. The end atoms are assumed to interact only with their nearest neighbors on the interior of the lattice and are otherwise free. If the numbers of atoms having masses m$\alpha$ and m$\beta$ are equal, there exists a single mode whose frequency squared lies at the middle of the "forbidden" gap between the optical and acoustical branches. For this "surface" mode the displacements of the atoms from their equilibrium positions decrease roughly exponentially from the end having the lighter atom. For the case of N atoms of mass m$\beta$ and N+1 atoms of mass m$\alpha$ there exist two modes whose frequencies lie in the "forbidden" gap provided (m$\alpha$/m$\beta$){\textless}N/(N+1). These modes correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric displacements. The displacements are largest for the end atoms and decrease roughly exponentially toward the center of the lattice.},

In addition to propagating acoustic and optic branches, this model is known to support a ``gap mode'' localized at the surface, provided the atom at the surface has light rather than heavy mass. An elementary argument is given which explains this mode and provides values for the frequency and localization length. By reinterpreting this mode in different ways, we obtain the frequency and localization lengths for three other interesting modes: (1) the surface vibrational mode of a light mass impurity at the surface of a monatomic chain; (2) the localized vibrational mode of a stacking fault in a diatomic chain; and (3) the localized vibrational mode of a light mass impurity in a monatomic chain.},

abstract = {We show that the discrete diffraction properties of a nonlinear optical zigzag waveguide array can be significantly modified, by exploiting the topological arrangement of the lattice itself. This introduces extended interactions (beyond nearest neighbors), which, in turn, affect the lattice dispersion relation within the Brillouin zone. As a result of this band alteration, we demonstrate that altogether different families of discrete soliton solutions are possible, which are stable over a wide range of parameters. In the regime where instabilities occur, all scenarios are considered in detail. By appropriately engineering the geometrical configuration of the array we find both standing and traveling diffraction-free beams. Our method opens opportunities for diffraction management that can be employed to generate low-power spatial discrete optical solitons.},

First, a theoretical analysis is presented, which gives the vibration modes of an infinite chain, leading to two low-frequency branches, separated by a band gap.Atheoretical analysis is then performed on a finite chain, containing an even or an odd number of spheres. Depending on the parity of the number of spheres in the finite chain and on the ratio between the masses of the spheres, it points out that localized modes may appear in the band gap. The theoretical results have been validated by a comparison between numerical and experimental results. Many applications of such systems can therefore be found: acoustic filters, noise and vibration isolation, acoustic wave guiding, etc. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.

Over the past three decades it was gradually realized that the Berry phase of the electronic wave function can have a profound effect on material properties and is responsible for a spectrum of phenomena, such as polarization, orbital magnetism, various (quantum, anomalous, or spin) Hall effects, and quantum charge pumping. This progress is summarized in a pedagogical manner in this review. A brief summary of necessary background is given and a detailed discussion of the Berry phase effect in a variety of solid-state applications. A common thread of the review is the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics, which is a versatile tool in the study of electron dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic fields and more general perturbations. Finally, a requantization method is demonstrated that converts a semiclassical theory to an effective quantum theory. It is clear that the Berry phase should be added as an essential ingredient to our understanding of basic material properties. � 2010 The American Physical Society.},

Granular crystals are one type of nonlinear periodic phononic structure and are the focus of this chapter. The chapter begins with a brief history of nonlinear lattices and an introduction to granular crystals. This is followed by a summary of past and recent work on one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) granular crystals, which is categorized according to the crystals' periodicity and dynamical regime. The chapter is concluded with a commentary by the authors, which discusses several possible future directions relating to granular crystals and other nonlinear periodic phononic structures. Throughout this chapter, a richness of nonlinear dynamic effects that occur in granular crystals is revealed, including a plethora of phenomena with no linear analog such as solitary waves, discrete breathers, tunable frequency band gaps, bifurcations, and chaos. Furthermore, in addition to the description of fundamental nonlinear phenomena, the authors describe how such phenomena can enable novel engineering devices and be applied to other nonlinear periodic systems.",

abstract = {The study of phononic materials and structures is an emerging discipline that lies at the crossroads of vibration and acoustics engineering and condensed matter physics. Broadly speaking, a phononic medium is a material or structural system that usually exhibits some form of periodicity, which can be in the constituent material phases, or the internal geometry, or even the boundary conditions. As such, its overall dynamical characteristics are compactly described by a frequency band structure, in analogy to an electronic band diagram. With roots extended to early studies of periodic systems by Newton and Rayleigh, the field has grown to encompass engineering configurations ranging from trusses and ribbed shells to phononic crystals and metamaterials. While applied research in this area has been abundant in recent years, treatment from a fundamental mechanics perspective, and particularly from the standpoint of dynamical systems, is needed to advance the field in new directions. For example, techniques already developed for the incorporation of damping and nonlinearities have recently been applied to wave propagation in phononic materials and structures. Similarly, numerical and experimental approaches originally developed for the characterization of conventional materials and structures are now being employed toward better understanding and exploitation of phononic systems. This article starts with an overview of historical developments and follows with an in-depth literature and technical review of recent progress in the field with special consideration given to aspects pertaining to the fundamentals of dynamics, vibrations, and acoustics. Finally, an outlook is projected onto the future on the basis of the current trajectories of the field.},

In particular, this suggests unidirectional waveguides that allow light to flow around large imperfections without back-reflection.

abstract = {Networks of rigid bars connected by joints, termed linkages, provide a minimal framework to design robotic arms and mechanical metamaterials built of folding components. Here, we investigate a chain-like linkage that, according to linear elasticity, behaves like a topological mechanical insulator whose zero-energy modes are localized at the edge. Simple experiments we performed using prototypes of the chain vividly illustrate how the soft motion, initially localized at the edge, can in fact propagate unobstructed all of the way to the opposite end. Using real prototypes, simulations, and analytical models, we demonstrate that the chain is a mechanical conductor, whose carriers are nonlinear solitary waves, not captured within linear elasticity. Indeed, the linkage prototype can be regarded as the simplest example of a topological metamaterial whose protected mechanical excitations are solitons, moving domain walls between distinct topological mechanical phases. More practically, we have built a topologically protected mechanism that can perform basic tasks such as transporting a mechanical state from one location to another. Our work paves the way toward adopting the principle of topological robustness in the design of robots assembled from activated linkages as well as in the fabrication of complex molecular nanostructures.},

abstract = {Acoustic metamaterials can manipulate and control sound waves in ways that are not possible in conventional materials. Metamaterials with zero, or even negative, refractive index for sound offer new possibilities for acoustic imaging and for the control of sound at subwavelength scales. The combination of transformation acoustics theory and highly anisotropic acoustic metamaterials enables precise control over the deformation of sound fields, which can be used, for example, to hide or cloak objects from incident acoustic energy. Active acoustic metamaterials use external control to create effective material properties that are not possible with passive structures and have led to the development of dynamically reconfigurable, loss-compensating and parity-time-symmetric materials for sound manipulation. Challenges remain, including the development of efficient techniques for fabricating large-scale metamaterial structures and converting laboratory experiments into useful devices. In this Review, we outline the designs and properties of materials with unusual acoustic parameters (for example, negative refractive index), discuss examples of extreme manipulation of sound and, finally, provide an overview of future directions in the field.},

In the mechanical setup, such surface modes can be used for various applications such as wave-guiding, vibration isolation, or the design of static properties such as stable floppy modes where parts of a system move freely. Here, we provide a classification scheme of topological phonons based on local symmetries. We import and adapt the classification of non-interacting electron systems and embed it into the mechanical setup. Moreover, we provide an extensive set of examples that illustrate our scheme and can be used to generate new models in unexplored symmetry classes. Our works unifies the vast recent literature on topological phonons and paves the way to future applications of topological surface modes in mechanical metamaterials.},

abstract = {We show theoretically that a photonic topological insulator can support edge solitons that are strongly self-localized and propagate unidirectionally along the lattice edge. The photonic topological insulator consists of a Floquet lattice of coupled helical waveguides, in a medium with local Kerr nonlinearity. The soliton behavior is strongly affected by the topological phase of the linear lattice. The topologically nontrivial phase gives a continuous family of solitons, while the topologically trivial phase gives an embedded soliton that occurs at a single power, and arises from a self-induced local nonlinear shift in the inter-site coupling. The solitons can be used for nonlinear switching and logical operations, functionalities that have not yet been explored in topological photonics. We demonstrate using solitons to perform selective filtering via propagation through a narrow channel, and using soliton collisions for optical switching.},

abstract = {Soft structures with rationally designed architectures capable of large, nonlinear deformation present opportunities for unprece- dented, highly tunable devices and machines. However, the highly dissipative nature of soft materials intrinsically limits or prevents certain functions, such as the propagation of mechanical signals. Herewe present an architected soft system composed of elastomeric bistable beam elements connected by elastomeric linear springs. The dissipative nature of the polymer readily damps linear waves, preventing propagation of any mechanical signal beyond a short distance, as expected. However, the unique architecture of the system enables propagation of stable, nonlinear solitary transition waves with constant, controllable velocity and pulse geometry over arbitrary distances. Because the high damping of the material removes all other linear, small-amplitude excitations, the desired pulse propagateswith high fidelity and controllability. This phenom- enon can be used to control signals, as demonstrated by the design of soft mechanical diodes and logic gates.},

The spatial variation of particles' stiffness results in an in-situ transition of the system's topology. This manifests as the emergence of a boundary mode in the finite system, which we observe experimentally via laser Doppler vibrometry. When two topologically different systems are placed adjacently, we analytically predict and computationally and experimentally demonstrate the existence of a finite-frequency topologically protected mode at their interface.},

This proposal promises unique avenues for engineering phases of light with topological character.We propose a scheme to realize a topological insulator with optical-passive elements and analyze the effects of Kerr nonlinearities in its topological behavior. In the linear regime, our design gives rise to an optical spectrum with topological features and where the bandwidths and bandgaps are dramatically broadened. The resulting edge modes cover a very wide frequency range. We relate this behavior to the fact that the effective Hamiltonian describing the system{\textquoteright}s amplitudes is long range.

In the first two cases, we find a correspondence between the topological transition of the underlying linear lattice and the power threshold of the transmittance, and show that the transmission behavior is attributable to the emergence of a self-induced topological soliton. In the third case, we show that the topological transition produces a discontinuity in the transmittance curve, which can be exploited to achieve sharp jumps in the power-dependent isolation ratio.},

abstract = {This work investigates the effect of nonlinearities on topologically protected edge states in one and two-dimensional phononic lattices. We first show that localized modes arise at the interface between two spring-mass chains that are inverted copies of each other. Explicit expressions derived for the frequencies of the localized modes guide the study of the effect of cubic nonlinearities on the resonant characteristics of the interface which are shown to be described by a Duffing-like equation. Nonlinearities produce amplitude-dependent frequency shifts, which in the case of a softening nonlinearity cause the localized mode to migrate to the bulk spectrum. The case of a hexagonal lattice implementing a phononic analogue of a crystal exhibiting the quantum spin Hall effect is also investigated in the presence of weakly nonlinear cubic springs. An asymptotic analysis provides estimates of the amplitude dependence of the localized modes, while numerical simulations illustrate how the lattice response transitions from bulk-to-edge mode-dominated by varying the excitation amplitude. In contrast with the interface mode of the first example studies, this occurs both for hardening and softening springs. The results of this study provide a theoretical framework for the investigation of nonlinear effects that induce and control topologically protected wave-modes through nonlinear interactions and amplitude tuning.},

This is achieved by showing theoretically that the classical 1D nonlinear Schrödinger equation governs the envelope of 2D edge modes. The theoretical predictions from the 1D envelope equation are confirmed by numerical simulations of the original 2D system for various types of traveling waves and rogue waves. As a result of topological protection, these edge solitons persist over long time intervals and through irregular boundaries.

Of 200 women in the study, 66 (33{\%}) had histologically proven CIN II or CIN III, 59 (29{\%}) had CIN I or human papillomavirus changes, and 54 (27{\%}) were considered normal. These findings demonstrate the importance of adequate diagnosis of this group of women. Of 143 women who had had a single mildly dyskaryotic smear, 45 (31{\%}) had either CIN II or III. Age was not useful for predicting which women were at high risk of significant disease. Careful repeat cervical cytology correlated closely with the histological grade of the lesion. Repeat cytology was associated with an overall 24{\%} false-negative rate, but most missed lesions were of low grade. Repeat cytology correctly identified 82{\%} of all CIN lesions, and 93{\%} of the most significant lesions (CIN II and III). Women who have a mildly dyskaryotic smear followed by a negative smear should not be considered normal, but careful repeat cytology can be considered a reasonably safe practice.},

By exploiting the flat crease patterns that determine the dynamic folding and unfolding motion of origami, we are able to design an origami-based metamaterial that can form rarefaction solitary waves. Our analytical, numerical, and experimental results demonstrate that this rarefaction solitary wave overtakes initial compressive strain waves, thereby causing the latter part of the origami structure to feel tension first instead of compression under impact. This counterintuitive dynamic mechanism can be used to create a highly efficient{\textemdash}yet reusable{\textemdash}impact mitigating system without relying on material damping, plasticity, or fracture.},

Here, the topological edge states and topological gap solitons which reside in the same band gaps described by the nonlinear Dirac model are studied, in both one and two dimensions. Strong nonlinear interactions between these dissimilar topological modes, manifested in the efficient excitation of topological edge states by scattered traveling gap solitons are revealed. Nonlinear tunability of localized states is explicated with exact analytical solutions for the two-component spinor wave function. Our studies are complemented by spatiotemporal numerical modeling of the nonlinear scattering in 1D and 2D photonic lattices.},

abstract = {A design paradigm of topology has recently emerged to manipulate the flow of phonons. At its heart lies a topological transition to a nontrivial state with exotic properties. This framework has been limited to linear lattice dynamics so far. Here we show a topological transition in a nonlinear regime and its implication in emerging nonlinear solutions. We employ nonlinearity management such that the system consists of masses connected with two types of nonlinear springs, "stiffening" and "softening" types, alternating along the length. We show, analytically and numerically, that the lattice makes a topological transition simply by changing the excitation amplitude and invoking nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, we witness the emergence of a family of finite-frequency edge modes, not observed in linear phononic systems. We also report the existence of kink solitons at the topological transition point. These correspond to heteroclinic orbits that form a closed curve in the phase portrait separating the two topologically distinct regimes. These findings suggest that nonlinearity can be used as a strategic tuning knob to alter topological characteristics of phononic crystals. These also provide fresh perspectives towards understanding a different family of nonlinear solutions in light of topology.},

abstract = {Nonlinear transmission lines (NLTLs) are nonlinear electronic circuits used for parametric amplification and pulse generation, and it is known that left-handed NLTLs support enhanced harmonic generation while suppressing shock wave formation. We show experimentally that in a left-handed NLTL analogue of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattice, harmonic generation is greatly increased by the presence of a topological edge state. Previous studies of nonlinear SSH circuits focused on solitonic behaviours at the fundamental harmonic. Here, we show that a topological edge mode at the first harmonic can produce strong propagating higher-harmonic signals, acting as a nonlocal cross-phase nonlinearity. We find maximum third-harmonic signal intensities five times that of a comparable conventional left-handed NLTL, and a 250-fold intensity contrast between topologically nontrivial and trivial configurations. This work advances the fundamental understanding of nonlinear topological states, and may have applications for compact electronic frequency generators.},

abstract = "When the two arcs of the continuous phonon spectrum of the Floquet matrix of a discrete breather overlap on the unit circle, the breather solution in the infinite lattice might be stable while the corresponding solutions in finite systems appear to be unstable. More precisely, when the model parameters vary, the breather in the finite system exhibits a large number of collisions between the Floquet eigenvalues belonging to the phonon spectrum. These collisions correspond to complex cascades of instability thresholds followed near after by re-entrant stability thresholds. We interpret this complex structure on the basis of the band analysis of the matrix of the second variation of the action. Then we can predict that in the limit of an infinite system the number of instability and stability thresholds in the cascade diverges, but simultaneously the maximum amplitude of the instabilities vanishes, so that the breather in the infinite system recovers its linear stability (as long as all its other localized modes remain stable). This is the situation which is required in Cretegny et al. [Physica D 119 (1998) 73–87] for having inelastic phonon scattering with two channels. We also analyze the size effects when a Floquet eigenvalue associated with a localized mode collides with the Floquet continuous phonon spectrum with different Krein signature. In contrast to the previous case, the infinite system is unstable after the collision."

abstract = {Nonlinear classical Hamiltonian lattices exhibit generic solutions - discrete breathers. They are time-periodic and (typically exponentially) localized in space. The lattices have discrete translational symmetry. Discrete breathers are not confined to certain lattice dimensions. We will introduce the concept of these localized excitations and review their basic properties including dynamical and structural stability. We then focus on advances in the theory of discrete breathers in three directions - scattering of waves by these excitations, persistence of discrete breathers in long transient processes and thermal equilibrium, and their quantization. The second part of this review is devoted to a detailed discussion of recent experimental observations and studies of discrete breathers, including theoretical modelling of these experimental situations on the basis of the general theory of discrete breathers. In particular we will focus on their detection in Josephson junction networks, arrays of coupled nonlinear optical waveguides, Bose-Einstein condensates loaded on optical lattices, antiferromagnetic layered structures, PtCl based single crystals and driven micromechanical cantilever arrays. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present a partial review of results concerning the theory of Discrete Breathers in nonlinear hamiltonian and discrete systems. These special time-periodic solutions gained much interest during the last decade because they may be involved in numerous and various phenomena in physics and biophysics where they could produce nontrivial effects of energy focusing and transfer. We first review the principles which govern their existence and which are used in the existence proofs available up to now. Next we discuss their linear stability and the interaction of Discrete Breathers with small amplitude waves, showing also how they could grow or decay. We also briefly discuss the existence of intraband DBs in systems with a linear discrete spectrum which are not spatially periodic (random or otherwise) and where linear waves cannot propagate. We also show that nonlinearity may restore the existence of solutions that propagate energy. We review some results concerning energy transportation by DBs and especially the main features associated with their mobility. We briefly discuss new perspectives opened up by the theory for applications that, in particular, look especially interesting for biophysics. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = "The general question of how a beam becomes unstable has been one of the fundamental research topics among beam and accelerator physicists for several decades. In this study, we revisited the general problem of linear beam stability in periodic focusing systems by applying the concepts of Krein signature and band structure. We numerically calculated the eigenvalues and other associated characteristics of one-period maps, and discussed the stability properties of single-particle motions with skew quadrupoles and envelope perturbations in high-intensity beams on an equal footing. In particular, an application of the Krein theory to envelope instability analysis was newly attempted in this study. The appearance of instabilities is interpreted as the result of the collision between eigenmodes of opposite Krein signatures and the formation of a band gap."
